# Cluster Simulation Scheme

This repository is for sharing the codes of the VQE related experiments and simulations in https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00102. 

## VQE experiments
The code in this folder is for the experiments of running a 6-qubit VQE circuit on a 3-qubit chip (provided by IBM Quantum Experience) to estimate the ground energy of BeH2. It corresponds to the **Appendix VII: VQE experiments** of the paper. 

## Reduce the CC(g)
The code in this folder is for the simulations of demonstrating how to reduce the CC(g) in the VQE circuit. It corresponds to the **Appendix VIII: Reducing cc(g) in VQE** of the paper.

## Acknowledgement
The code of this experiment is based on the codes of https://github.com/iQuHACK/QUasiCoders. Thanks for the help from Linsen Li, Kaidong Peng, Yufeng Ye, and Zhen Guo.
